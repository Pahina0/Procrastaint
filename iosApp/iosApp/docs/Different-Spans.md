Things I learned: 

	Include this header on all new files: 
		//
		//  DayModel.swift
		//  iosApp
		//
		//  Created by Joe Fodera 10/25/2024.
		//  Copyright Â© 2024 orgName. All rights reserved.
		//

	//Previews the specific button or UI element without needing to setup an entire preview provider
		#Preview {
			BottomSheetView()
		}

	The 'list.bullet.clipboard' can be found in the sf symbols app I dowloaded, these are preloaded onto any IOS device and therefore
	do not need to import a library to use them: 
		.tabItem { Label("Today", systemImage: "list.bullet.clipboard") }
		
	I am working in SWIFTU rn. 
		swift is for the background logic while swiftUI is for the GUI .
