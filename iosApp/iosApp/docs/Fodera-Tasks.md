Overall Procrast-aint Notes 

When setting up env: 
	make sure I have a unique identifier: 
		the one for the main is PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER = procssnate.iosApp;
		Mine is PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER = procssnate.joe;

General Notes: 
	Shared backend is kotlin but frontend is swift
	Disables user script sandboxing 

	Wasn’t working because I needed to download andriod studio and make sure dependencies were running right, also needed to download gradle as it’s required for the android backend build 

	There was a space in file path which hopefully caused error-> that was the Error. 


	Create issue, new branch, and 
	don;t PR until after review, just leave it 



Future Tasks: 
	3ish year span √
		decided to go with 1 year because too much overhead
	
	adding month tabber at top √
	 
	Backend for actually adding a task -> doesn’t do that rn 
	Search by tag in library section
	Settings if have nothing else to commit 
	
	make calendar range dynamic, only load what you scroll
